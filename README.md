# CumulusMX Weather Probability Visualizations

Effortlessly visualize weather probabilities with Highcharts and CumulusMX data. This repository provides JavaScript code to generate interactive charts, offering detailed insights into rainfall and temperature likelihoods.

## Key Features

### 1. Daily Rainfall Probability
- Displayed using a spline chart.
- Provides a caption indicating the probability of rain today.

### 2. Monthly Rainfall Probability
- Displayed using a spline chart.
- Data labels show the probability values.

### 3. Gaussian Rainfall Distribution
- Displayed using a bell curve (bellcurve type) and a hidden series.
- Provides a visual representation of the Gaussian distribution of rainfall data.

### 4. Rainfall Confidence Intervals
- Displayed using an areasplinerange chart for confidence intervals and a spline chart for actual rainfall.
- Highlights confidence intervals and actual rainfall values.

### 5. Temperature Probability Charts
- Explore the likelihood of temperature ranges.
- Visualize probabilities for various temperature scenarios.

## Important Note

To ensure accurate data integration, remember to modify the `resources.js` file according to your data source details.

Ensure a reliable dataset by having a substantial amount of data (> 5 years) for accurate and meaningful visualizations.
